# Diet Coke dividend calculator

This is a simple web app to calculate how many shares of Coke you would need to own to pay for your daily Diet Coke via dividend income.

## How it works

On load the app will fetch Coke's ($KO) current share price from [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/). The current share price is then used to calculate how many shares you would need to own in order to pay for your daily Diet Coke via dividend income.

I've statically set the quarterly dividend to $0.51 per share which is correct as of 2025-03-17.
